# Samsung OCT Project

## Intro

## Implementation details
### The Notebooks
- `data_wrangling_from_kaggle_dataset.ipynb`  
An analysis of the [dataset provided in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/kermany2018/).
- `data_wrangling_from_mendeley.ipynb`  
An analysis of the [dataset provided in Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3).

Notebook to define hyperparameters for the classification problem of the OCT dataset.
- `v1 OCT TensorFlow Resnet 50 Model.ipynb`  
First attempt to train a Resnet50 for classification of the different conditions. Using TensorFlow's default parameters.
- `v2 OCT TensorFlow Resnet 50 Model.ipynb`  
Second attempt to train a Resnet50 for classification of the different conditions. Using tested parameters and earning Rate reduction on plateau.

Transfer learning experiment, a Resnet50 trained on an OCT dataset and then used that model as transfer learning for a reduced OCT dataset.
- `v2_reduced OCT TensorFlow Resnet 50 Model.ipynb`  
Some later experiments use a reduced training dataset, this serves as a baseline for those experiments.
